Abstract:
================================================================================

Election science has made several attempts to quantify the differences in outcomes between various voting rules.  

These attempts have used either candidates drawn from the population or survey data to quantify the results.  

Each of these methods fail to account for the possibility of candidates applying strategy to increase their chances of winning.

This paper attempts to examine the outcomes of Hare and Condorcet methods presuming that the candidates will make strategic decisions about their ideology with the goal of winning the election.  

First, I show that, given two candidates, the ideal ideological position for the third candidate and the outcome varies between Hare and Condorcet consistent methods.

Second, I use machine learning to estimate the likelihood of candidates winning a race with a given ideological platform.  

These methods both show that candidates employ strategy will defeat those who choose their ideology without considering strategy.  Further, they show that the optimal strategy for Hare is signficantly different from and produces significantly different ideological outcomes for Hare and Condorcet compliant methods.

Third, I discuss the implications for using voter surveys to estimate outcomes between election systems.

Finally, this paper makes the point that the election reform community has relied upon the election science community to provide insight into the consequences of reform.  

Prior academic work has implied that Hare/IRV would yield the same outcome as Condorcet compliant methods in the vast majority of cases.  

While true for random candidates, this result has little relevance when candidates employ strategy.  

Consequently, election reform proposals currently adopted in Maine and Alaska may not have the outcomes desired by the reform community.



Introduction:
================================================================================

Find reference to first attempts to estimate / simulate outcomes with different election systems.  
This is probably present in prior works by Merrill, Armytage, and or Tideman.  
Cite them and that for members of the reform community these were the only information available when deciding which reforms made the most sense to implement.
